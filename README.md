# google-homepage
Things I learned:
- use :hover to add mouse over effects in css
- use display: flex to add flex box and design the webpage with a grid
- use display: inline-block to get elements to line up next to each other
- use float: to align left or right
- you can add border: to search box to change the way it looks
- you can only use ids once and classes multiple times
- id's can be located on the webpage

Didn't figure out:
- how to add space above logo

- why footer is off center
solution: add left:0;   also position: had an effect

- how to add images on top of search bar

- cant get svg in header to work
